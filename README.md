# Movie Ratings App
This application lets you preview and download the top ten movies from any year, sorted based on the title or the number of votes. First, choose the release year for the selection of movies. Next, choose if you want the full/original title or the simplified title ("A" and "The" moved to the end of the title). Then, choose how you want the data to be sorted (by "Votes" or "Title"). Finally, check the table preview and click the button to download it to a .csv file.
